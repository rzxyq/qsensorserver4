UNITTEST AND REFACTORING
data_ module now contains unittest. Everytime you make any changes make sure to run "python manage.py test data_" to make sure all tests pass.

URL
Urls changed slightly to make it more intuitive. /data/eda_view, /data/mean_view etc. are now the urls for viewing data.

ADMIN AND MODELS
Added trial and model one-to-many relationship. Added admin interface. Can now go to /admin (relative path, e.g. localhost:8000/admin) to view Trial and Data. Password and username are both ruoyanqin.

DATABASE
For simpler backup and moving the using the repo on different computers, switched from Postgres to sqlite. Can now view data directly in db.sqlite3 and copy/paste. 

VIRTUAL ENV
Can "source activate"  into the virtual env in Venv now. Alternative is to "pip install -r requirements.txt"


New instructions:
Go to qsensorserver4/data_, open up 3 terminals at this location
Edit qsensorpost.py IMPORTANT. Change trial number.
Make sure sensor is connected and server is running on terminal 1, then run ./collect.sh on terminal 2
Check printlns on the terminal 1. If itâ€™s getting eda values, go to step 4. Else, run qsensorpost.py
View values at localhost:8000/data/eda_view, localhost:8000/data/frequency_view, localhost:8000/data/sums_view, localhost:8000/data/mean_view.
Additionally, go to localhost:8000/admin with password&username ruoyanqin. Click on trials and you can see or delete or rename trials.
